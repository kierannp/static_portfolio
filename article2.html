<h1 class="Article-title">Da Vinci’s Wire</h1>
<br>
<div class="Article">
<p>Is a long wire stronger than a short wire?</p>
<br>
<p>Lenoardo Da Vinci was a great inventor and showed insight beyond belief.
In a notebook written by Da Vinci’s there is an interesting experiment titled, “Testing the strength of iron wires of
various lengths”. In this experiment Da Vinci was studying the properties of wires undergoing tension. The basic setup
of the experiment was to hang a basket from a wire and then slowly add sand into the basket until the wire inevitably
snaps. Once the wire had snapped, the maximum load of the wire could be calculated.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Counter intuitively, Da Vinci noted that longer wires snapped under less force than shorter wires. Why does that make
any sense? Let me explain why this is strange with some basic engineering.
</p>
<br>
<p>The amount of force a material can withstand before breaking is actually not correct. This is because the thickness of
the material affects the amount of force required to break it. Thinking back to the wires, a thicker wire would require
more force to break. This is a simple explanation for the concept of material stress. Stress is defined as the force
applied to the material divided by the perpendicular cross-sectional area to the applied force. For example, lets say a
wire snaps under 50 lbs of force. 50 lbs isn’t too much, I sure most of us could easily lift that. But, the stress in
this case is quite large. If we looked at a cross section of a wire we would see a circle, fare enough. Let’s say the
wire is …. TOO MUCH the unit that matters isn’t the force required to fracture, it is the stress required to fracture.
</p>
<br>
<p>
So why would a longer wire snap well before a smaller wire? I’ll give you a hint, we don’t live in a perfect world.
There is no such thing as a perfect wire or a perfect anything. Wires have flaws. When you increase the length of a
wire, although the stress of the wire stays the same, the overall quantity of impurities and flaws in that wire increase
approximately proportionally to the length of the wire.

<p>
So why am I talking about wires?
This idea applies not only to materials, but fields such as game theory, corporate structure, …
Let’s explore governmental structures for example
