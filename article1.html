<h1 class="Article-title">Broken Child on the Streets of Kampala</h1>

<div class="Article">
<p>The crowded concrete streets of Kamapala had an excitement to them. I was told earlier by Ugandan friends that police in
Uganda are rated amoung the most corrup in the world, but they didn't need to tell me that. We had been pulled over earlier
for speeding; this was one of the scariest things I have every experienced. Our driver had been going around 130 km/h 
(~80 mph) in a 85 km/h (50 mph). Culturally, Ugandan drive with a ferocity that would cause any Westerner to shit their
This was mine and my friend Gian Luca's reaction at least. Us Westerners were not skilled enough to survive those Ugandan 
roads. On the rural highways of Uganda police do not roam the roads stalking their prey, they simply sit down in the shade 
and wait for their prey to come to them. To catch speeders, the police setup road block on long straight sections of the road
and watch with binorculars for fast cars. They caught us. </p>

    Our driver got out of the car to talk to the police officer. The two talked approx. 20 feet away from the car in Swahili.
    Listening was a lost cause. The only thing I could do was pay attention to their body language.

That little boy didn’t know the world yet, he
didn’t even know what was beyoung his small existence. I was 18 and he was maybe four. When I was walking in through one
of the main streets in Kampala I saw the crowd begin to move in a wave motion around a single point. As i came closer to
the origin of this disturbance in the movement of the crowd I saw a small boy with his head down in the fetal position.
He wasn’t asking for money or food, nor for attention. He wasn’t asking for anything from anyone. He was just crumbled
up on the cement like a paper that had been thrown aside. I looked at him for a moment and then averted my gaze as soon
as I could. I passed him like the rest of the crowd around me, choosing to not see. I had never seen anything like that
before. Someone so young and so hopeless. There was no one there to help this child, if you could even call him that.
Children are what we call the innocent and the ignorant. From my perspective this boy was neither. I was 18 at that time
and the boy was maybe 4. This experience still haunts me.
